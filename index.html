  <em>  I would portray myself as a sharp, cooperative individual who is willing and able to follow 
instructions, yet possess the skills to take leadership positions. I have also been told to 
be quite a thinker and this quality has aided me in finding innovative solutions to problems.
My career choices include primarily actuary or a satisfying job in computer science field. 
However I mainly wish to just be successful in which ever career field I am in. </em>
